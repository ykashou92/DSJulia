10 Data Science problems solved with the Julia programming language

## Purpose
The idea is to tackle 10 different problems in data science and arrive at a reasonable, creative, efficient and beautiful solution using the Julia programming language. 

It is just a method of practice, like self-assignments.
The purpose is to showcase my a bit of capability with the Julia language

## The 10 Problems and their respective solutions
This repo will contain 10 .ipynb solution report files

1. Use image processing and use a popular machine learning algorithm to identify characters from pictures with high accuracy
